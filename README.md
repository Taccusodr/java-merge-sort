# Overview

This project implements basic disk-backed multi-way merge sort, with configurable input and output formats (i.e. not just textual sort).
It should be useful for systems that process large amounts of data, as a simple building block for sort phases.

# Usage

(work-in-progress!)

# Getting involved
